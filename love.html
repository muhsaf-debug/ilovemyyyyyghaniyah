  <h1>To My Love, Ghaniyah <span class="heart">üíñ</span></h1>

  <div class="container">
    <p>Meeting you was something I never expected but everything I needed, and every day since that first message came across the screen, my life has shifted in ways I didn‚Äôt know were possible. Before you, things felt so dull and often meaningless, but the moment you came into my world  even through a screen  the colors got brighter, time began to matter, and I started to wake up with a purpose.</p>

    <p>I didn‚Äôt think love like this existed outside of books until you showed me it was real and beautiful, even in a digital form. These past 161 days have been the most meaningful days of my entire life, and I've improved a lot. I‚Äôve learned that love doesn‚Äôt need to be physical to be real; it just needs to be honest and full of intention. And that‚Äôs exactly what we‚Äôve had  real moments, real conversations, real laughter.</p>

    <p>You‚Äôve taught me how to be patient, how to communicate better, and how to believe in something greater than myself. Every second we spent talking, sharing, dreaming, and supporting one another, or even just playing around, has created memories I‚Äôll never forget, no matter where life takes us.</p>

    <p>There were days I doubted myself, questioned the future, but your voice, your words, your presence, and your pictures always helped me smile and forget all the problems. You‚Äôve been my safe place, my motivation, my light during the darkest hours, and the person who reminded me of who I truly am. (You literally give me hope when I am hopeless.)</p>

    <p>You saw potential in me even when I couldn‚Äôt, and that changed everything. I used to wonder what love really felt like, and now I know: it feels like home. And <strong>you are my home</strong>.</p>

    <p>Every time I see you smile, my heart feels it and soars. And every time I say ‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù I mean it deeper than anyone else ever could. I love you not just for who you are, but for how you make me feel, how you inspire me, how you push me to grow, and how you‚Äôve become the most important person in my life.</p>

    <p>Even though we‚Äôve been separated because of some issues, and only had screens to bridge the gap, it never stopped me from feeling close to you, connected to you, or in love with you. In fact, the love through screens made me miss you deeply, and love you harder. It made every second we spent together blessed.</p>

    <p>Whether we were watching something, talking until the middle of the night, or simply just playing with each other  those 161 days were filled with more love than some people experience in a lifetime (imo).</p>

    <p>I think about you constantly  in an obsessive way, and in a grateful one. When something good happens, you‚Äôre the first person I want to tell. When I feel low, your picture is all I need to see. When I think about the future, you‚Äôre in every version of it. I want to be there for you through every high and low, to support your dreams, to hold your hand when life gets tough, and to love you unconditionally just as you‚Äôve loved me.</p>

    <p class="signature">I love you so much, Ghaniyah ü©∑<br>Mwahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh üíã</p>
